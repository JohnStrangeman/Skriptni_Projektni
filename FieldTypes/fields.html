                Clay courts are made of crushed shale, stone or brick. 
                This surface slows down the ball and produces a slow and high bounce compared to other surfaces. 
                This makes rallies generally longer and more suitable for base line players and players who like to play tactically using lots of spin and finding great angles.
                This surface takes away many of the advantages of big serves, making it hard for players who rely heavily on their serve to dominate on clay. 
                One of the most famous clay court tournaments in the world is Roland Garros.

                Grass is the traditional lawn tennis surface and famously the signature courts of Wimbledon. 
                It's not a surface you'll see that often these days due to theconstant maintenance required to 
                keep the courts in tip-top conditionThis surface plays very quick and the ball generally bounces low, 
                keeping rallies relatively short. On grass, players must get to the ball much more quickly than on 
                clay or hard courts and often plays into the hands of net players and those who like to serve and volley 
                as a tactic. The serve also plays more of a key part in the game than it does on other surfaces
                The Most famous grass tournament is Wimbledon.

            As the name suggests hard courts are made of uniformed, rigid materials with an acrylic surface layer. 
            This surface is very popular across the world as it generally gives a good even and 'all round'
             playing experience and offers more consistency than other outdoor surfaces.
            Although the speed of play on hard courts can depend on the exact material used, 
            they are generally faster than clay, but not as fast as grass. 
            Both the Australian and US opens are played on this surface. The US Open is played on an
             acrylic hard court while the Australian Open is played on a synthetic surface.
